Food uses of onions date back thousands of years in China, Egypt and Persia.<div>
</div><div>Traces of onions recovered from Bronze Age settlements in China suggest that onions were used as far back as 5000 BCE, not only for their flavour, but the bulb's durability in storage and transport. Ancient Egyptians revered the onion bulb, viewing its spherical shape and concentric rings as symbols of eternal life.Onions were used in Egyptian burials, as evidenced by onion traces found in the eye sockets of Ramesses IV.</div><div>
</div><div>Pliny the Elder of the first century CE wrote about the use of onions and cabbage in Pompeii. He documented Roman beliefs about the onion's ability to improve ocular ailments, aid in sleep, and heal everything from oral sores and toothaches to dog bites, lumbago, and even dysentery. Archaeologists unearthing Pompeii long after its 79 CE volcanic burial have found gardens resembling those in Pliny's detailed narratives. According to texts collected in the fifth/sixth century CE under the authorial aegis of "Apicius" (said to have been a gourmet), onions were used in many Roman recipes.</div><div>
</div><div>In the Age of Discovery, onions were taken to North America by the first European settlers only to discover the plant readily available, and in wide use in Native American gastronomy.According to diaries kept by certain of the first English colonists, the bulb onion was one of the first crops planted by the Pilgrim fathers</div></div>
