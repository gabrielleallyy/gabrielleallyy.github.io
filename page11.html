                <blockquote>Onions are best cultivated in fertile soils that are well-drained. Sandy loams are good as they are low in sulphur, while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs. Onions require a high level of nutrients in the soil. Phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities, but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils. Nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season, the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting.Bulbing onions are day-length sensitive; their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity. Most traditional European onions are referred to as "long-day" onions, producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs. Southern European and North African varieties are often known as "intermediate-day" types, requiring only 12–13 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation. Finally, "short-day" onions, which have been developed in more recent times, are planted in mild-winter areas in the autumn and form bulbs in the early spring, and require only 11–12 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation. Onions are a cool-weather crop and can be grown in USDA zones 3 to 9.Hot temperatures or other stressful conditions cause them to "bolt", meaning that a flower stem begins to grow.</blockquote><blockquote><span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">Onions may be grown from seed or from sets. Onion seeds are short-lived and fresh seeds germinate better. The seeds are sown thinly in shallow drills, thinning the plants in stages. In suitable climates, certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter in the ground and produce early crops the following year. Onion sets are produced by sowing seed thickly in early summer in poor soil and the small bulbs produced are harvested in the autumn. These bulbs are planted the following spring and grow into mature bulbs later in the year. Certain cultivars are used for this purpose and these may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed.</span><br></blockquote><blockquote>
<span style="font-size: 1.09rem;">Routine care during the growing season involves keeping the rows free of competing weeds, especially when the plants are young. The plants are shallow-rooted and do not need a great deal of water when established. Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks. The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be kept in storage, they should be harvested after the leaves have died back naturally. In dry weather, they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days to dry out properly, then they can be placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes. They should be stored in a well-ventilated, cool place such as a shed.</span></blockquote>

                    <li>Plant onions as soon as the ground can be worked in the spring, usually late March or April. Make sure outdoor temperatures&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;dip below 20°F&nbsp;(-6°C).
</li><li>Select a location with full sun, where your onions won’t be shaded by other&nbsp;plants.
</li><li>Soil needs to be well-drained, loose, and rich in nitrogen; compact soil affects bulb&nbsp;development.
</li><li>Add aged manure or compost to the soil in early spring, before planting. Onion plants&nbsp;are heavy feeders and need constant nourishment to produce big&nbsp;bulbs.
</li><li>At planting time, mix in some nitrogen&nbsp;fertilizer.
</li><li>Onion seeds are short-lived. If planting seeds indoors, start with fresh seeds each year.            Start seeds indoors about 6 weeks before transplanting to the&nbsp;garden.
</li><li>Think of onions as a leaf crop, not a root crop. When planting onion sets, don’t bury them more than 1 inch under the&nbsp;soil.
</li><li><span style="font-size: 1rem;">For sets or transplants, space plants 4 to 5 inches apart in rows 12 to 18 inches&nbsp;apart</span><br></li><li><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Practice crop rotation with&nbsp;onions.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Add mulch between the rows of onions. This will help       	retain moisture and stifle&nbsp;weeds.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Find&nbsp;more tips on planting onions&nbsp;in different regions    	and&nbsp;soils.</span></li>
